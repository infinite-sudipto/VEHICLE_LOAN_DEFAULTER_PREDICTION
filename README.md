# VEHICLE_LOAN_DEFAULTER_PREDICTION
Financial institutions incur significant losses due to the default of vehicle loans. This has led to the tightening up of vehicle loan underwriting and an increase in vehicle loan rejection rates. The need for a better credit risk scoring model is also raised by these institutions. 
üêç Welcome to the Python EDA Project!  This project is designed for exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, focusing on data cleaning, preprocessing, hypothesis testing using regression models, descriptive statistics, and data visualization. 

There is one dataset with data that has 41 attributes.
You are required to determine and examine factors that affect the ratio of vehicle loan defaulters. Also, use the findings to create a model to predict the potential defaulters.
